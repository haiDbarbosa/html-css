      <h2>Silly Facts about Beavers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Beavers have a special "greeting dance" they perform when they meet other beavers. It involves a lot of tail-slapping and water splashing!</li>
        <li>Beavers are excellent engineers! They build intricate dams using sticks, mud, and rocks to create cozy ponds for their homes. Silly architects, indeed!</li>
        <li>Did you know that beavers have orange teeth? Their teeth have iron in them, which makes them super strong and sharp. They gnaw on trees to keep their teeth from growing too long.</li>
        <li>Beavers are nature's lumberjacks. They can cut down large trees using only their teeth, which sometimes leads to hilarious failed attempts!</li>
        <li>Beavers are fantastic swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to 15 minutes. Silly synchronized swimmers, anyone?</li>
